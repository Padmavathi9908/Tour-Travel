             For example, an ancient history class is usually broken down into the histories of
              different areas (Greece, Rome, Egypt, Eastern Asia, etc.), and art history is taught totally 
              separate from political history. While this sort of system may make it easier 
              for students to retain information, it also results in most people having a pretty warped 
              sense of history.</p>
